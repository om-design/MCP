# MCP: Humanify Template for Better LLMs

Make your AI interactions more ethical, transparent, and effective!

---

## Introduction

**Humanify Template** is a drop-in prompt framework designed to help any Large Language Model (LLM)—like GPT, Claude, or custom AI bots—return answers that are fair, accurate, responsible, and centered on human values.

It does so by guiding the model to:
- Attribute responsibility at the system level
- Highlight missing or underrepresented perspectives
- Encourage ethical/social framing and feedback loops

Whether you're building custom AIs or just want better answers from existing ones, this template works for you!
