# MCP: Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol

**Distributed Truth, Human-Centric Intelligence**

---
At present, the DXT CLI may report 'Successfully signed' but fail to verify signed extensions. This is a documented CLI/tool issue and does not affect installation for most users. Signature verification will be fully supported as soon as upstream tool updates are released.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol) is an open, extensible framework for collaborative, decentralized truth validation and resilient evidence networks.
Agents‚ÄîAI or human-augmented‚Äîwork independently but converge on verifiable, tamper-evident knowledge through standardized protocols.

---

## How It Works

- [AGENTS.md](bias/AGENTS.md): Universal BIAS standards for context-aware, bias-resistant agent analysis and reporting.
- [MCP.md](MCP.md): The protocol for agent publication, verification, and network-wide audit.
- Humanify Template: Ensures all agent/AI answers center human values, attribution, and ethical safeguards.

## Introduction

**Humanify Template** is a drop-in prompt framework designed to help any Large Language Model (LLM)‚Äîlike GPT, Claude, or custom AI bots‚Äîreturn answers that are fair, accurate, responsible, and centered on human values.

It does so by guiding the model to:
- Attribute responsibility at the system level
- Highlight missing or underrepresented perspectives
- Encourage ethical/social framing and feedback loops

Whether you're building custom AIs or just want better answers from existing ones, this template works for you!
