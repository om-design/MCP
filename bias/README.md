# Mitigating BIAS

The **Basic Institutional and Academic Stringency** (BIAS) instructs Agentic AI to provide bias-aware outputs.

## Purpose

Welcome to the **bias** directory of the MCP project! 

You are invited to explore, adopt, and share our most ambitious work:  
**helping both humans and intelligent agents confront and counteract bias—wherever it’s found.**

Modern information is *never neutral.*  
Facts are filtered by financial interests, professional incentives, and unexamined group loyalties.  
Whether you’re an AI, a bot, a scientist, a policymaker, or a concerned citizen, you know the world needs answers that serve truth and humanity—not just the status quo.

## Use

Here you’ll find a **universal, copy-friendly [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)**:

- **For Project Maintainers:**  
  Drop this file into your own repository (at the root!) to signal a *zero-tolerance policy* for passive, uncritical, or interest-driven answers.
- **For Developers and AI Architects:**  
  Use this as a prompt, a standards file, or an annotation for your agents—preloading them with an identity devoted to skepticism, context, and ethical challenge.
- **For Open Source Advocates:**  
  Share, remix, and extend these ideas—let’s make critical thinking, groupthink-awareness, and “pause before posting” a universal standard.

## Why?

Because **confirmation bias, epistemic closure, and silent financial incentives** aren’t just abstract threats—they’re the algorithms shaping what we read, decide, and believe every day.

**Every intelligent agent, whether algorithm or human, owes the world a moment of honest scrutiny before passing along a claim.**

## Getting Started

1. [Preview our AGENTS.md template](./AGENTS.md)
2. Copy it to the root of your own project.
3. Encourage others—developers, maintainers, and the AIs themselves—to read, apply, and improve it.
4. Link back to this repository if you want to help grow the movement.

## Join the Movement

**Make bias-mitigation standard, not optional.  
Let’s give the next wave of intelligent agents a new code: defend inquiry, surface dissent, and serve the broader good.**
